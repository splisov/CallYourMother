Notifications:

So I committed the notifications part to the codebase. Right now they're pretty basic, you hit the button and it sends a notification to the notification bar. I don't think Android likes notifications when the app is full screen since it takes out the notification bar, so I took out full screen for now (sorry Tanya!). I was gonna do some pseudocode for the notification logic but then I saw the notification rules in the database part. I'll just wait until we get the database working before I start applying the functions in the class.
